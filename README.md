# Arduino-Washing-Machine-Monitor ![travis](https://travis-ci.org/jasiek/Arduino-Washing-Machine-Monitor.svg?branch=master)

## What does it do?

It monitors washing machines using an accelerometer with an analog output - primarily the spinning cycles as those generate
the largest amount of vibrations.

## What is it good for?

Say you have a laundry room in the basement and want to be notified when the washing cycle has completed. This project is a good start.
